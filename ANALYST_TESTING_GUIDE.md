## Expected API Calls

### 1. Fetch Officers for Assignment
```
GET /api/users?role=OFFICER&limit=100
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user_id",
      "name": "Officer Name",
      "email": "officer@email.com",
      "badge": "12345",
      "department": "Environmental Crimes"
    }
  ],
  "total": 10,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 100
}
```

### 2. Assign Officer to Report
```
PATCH /api/reports/[reportId]
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "assigneeId": "officer_user_id"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "report_id",
    "assigneeId": "officer_user_id",
    "assignee": {
      "id": "officer_user_id",
      "name": "Officer Name",
      "email": "officer@email.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Notification Trigger
When an officer is assigned, a notification should be created for the report author (citizen):
```json
{
  "type": "ASSIGNMENT",
  "title": "Officer Assigned",
  "message": "An officer has been assigned to investigate your report \"[Report Title]\".",
  "link": "/dashboard/reports/[reportId]",
  "userId": "[citizen_user_id]"
}
```

## Quick 2-Minute Test

1. **Login**: sarah.analyst@email.com / Password123!
2. **Click Bell Icon**: Verify no 404, see notifications
3. **Click Notification**: Verify navigates to report successfully
4. **Click "Assign Officer"**: Dialog opens with officer list
5. **Select Officer & Assign**: Success toast, page refreshes, officer shown
6. **Verify Citizen Gets Notification**: Login as citizen, check notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: 404 when clicking notifications
- **Solution**: Middleware has been updated to allow `/dashboard/reports/*` for all roles
- **Verify**: Check [apps/web/middleware.ts](apps/web/middleware.ts) line 23 includes `/dashboard/reports/*`

### Issue: "Assign Officer" button does nothing
- **Solution**: Button replaced with AssignOfficerDialog component
- **Verify**: Check [apps/web/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx](apps/web/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx) imports and uses AssignOfficerDialog

### Issue: No officers shown in dropdown
- **Possible causes**:
  1. No OFFICER role users in database
  2. API permission error (analysts can only fetch officers)
- **Solution**: Check database seed data or create officer users via admin panel

### Issue: Assignment succeeds but notification not sent
- **Check**: [apps/web/app/api/reports/[id]/route.ts](apps/web/app/api/reports/[id]/route.ts) lines 242-254
- **Verify**: `assigneeChanged` condition is true and notification creation succeeds

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All tests pass when:**
1. Analyst can click notifications without 404 errors
2. Analyst can access report detail pages via notification links
3. "Assign Officer" dialog opens and shows list of officers
4. Officer assignment succeeds and UI updates
5. Success toast appears after assignment
6. Citizen receives notification when officer is assigned
7. Reassignment works correctly

## Next Steps

After analyst role is fully tested, we can move on to:
- [ ] Officer role workflow
- [ ] Prosecutor role workflow
- [ ] Case management features
- [ ] Evidence management features
