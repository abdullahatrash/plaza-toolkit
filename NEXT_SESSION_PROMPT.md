## 🎉 What Was Just Completed: Officer Role (100%)

### ✅ Implemented Features (This Session)

1. **Officer Dashboard Enhancements** ([officer-dashboard.tsx](apps/web/components/dashboards/officer-dashboard.tsx))
   - Enhanced "My Assigned Reports" section (was "Recent Reports")
   - Added `activeCases` count to officer stats API
   - Improved stats display and quick actions

2. **Assigned Reports Page** ([reports/assigned/page.tsx](apps/web/app/dashboard/reports/assigned/page.tsx))
   - Dedicated page showing only reports assigned to the officer
   - Search, filter by status, and sort functionality
   - Status distribution stats (Under Review, In Progress, Resolved)
   - Responsive design with mobile support
   - Route: `/dashboard/reports/assigned`

3. **Update Status Dialog** ([update-status-dialog.tsx](apps/web/components/reports/update-status-dialog.tsx))
   - Validates status transitions (SUBMITTED → UNDER_REVIEW → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED)
   - Requires mandatory note/reason for status changes
   - Creates activity timeline entries automatically
   - Sends notifications to citizens automatically
   - Prevents invalid status transitions

4. **Investigation Notes System** ([notes-section.tsx](apps/web/components/reports/notes-section.tsx))
   - Display internal investigation notes on report detail page
   - Officers can add notes to assigned reports
   - Notes marked as internal (not visible to citizens)
   - Shows author role badges and timestamps
   - Real-time updates when new notes added

5. **Notes API** ([reports/[id]/notes/route.ts](apps/web/app/api/reports/[id]/notes/route.ts))
   - `GET /api/reports/[id]/notes` - Fetch notes with role-based filtering
   - `POST /api/reports/[id]/notes` - Create investigation notes
   - Only assigned officers, analysts, and admins can add notes
   - Citizens see only public notes (isInternal: false)

6. **Create Case Dialog** ([create-case-dialog.tsx](apps/web/components/cases/create-case-dialog.tsx))
   - Create investigation cases from reports
   - Auto-populates case title from report
   - Fields: title, description, priority
   - Automatically links current report to case
   - Redirects to case detail page after creation

7. **Enhanced Report Detail Page** ([reports/[id]/page.tsx](apps/web/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx))
   - Added "Investigation Actions" card for officers
   - Buttons: Update Status, Upload Evidence, Create Case
   - Shows warning if officer is not assigned to report
   - Only assigned officers can take investigation actions
   - Role-based action restrictions

8. **Updated Side Navigation** ([rbac-config.ts](apps/web/lib/rbac-config.ts))
   - Added nested "Reports" menu with:
     - "Assigned to Me" link → `/dashboard/reports/assigned`
     - "All Reports" link → `/dashboard/reports`
   - Improved officer navigation experience

9. **Enhanced APIs**
   - Reports API: Added `assigned=me` filter support
   - Report PATCH: Creates notes when status is updated
   - Cases API: Enhanced response format and activity logging
   - All APIs properly validate officer permissions

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- Fixed all TypeScript errors (was 35+ errors, now 0)
- Fixed Prisma schema usage (NoteType → isInternal boolean)
- Fixed ActivityType enum usage
- Enhanced permission checks for officer actions
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added proper loading states and skeletons

### 📋 Officer Workflow (Now 100% Complete)

```
1. Login as Officer
   ↓
2. View Dashboard
   - See assigned reports count
   - View recent activities
   - Quick access to assigned reports

## 🚀 What's Next: Analyst Role Enhancements

### Current Analyst Status: 60% Complete

**What Works**:
- ✅ View all reports in system
- ✅ Dashboard with stats
- ✅ Map view with filters
- ✅ Basic case management
- ✅ Evidence viewing
- ✅ Notifications

**What's Missing** (Priority Order):

### 1. 🔴 **CRITICAL: Officer Assignment UI**
**Impact**: HIGH - Analysts can't assign officers through UI
**Status**: Database supports it, API works, but NO UI

**Need to Build**:
- `AssignOfficerDialog` component (already exists! ✅)
- But needs to be added to report detail page for analysts
- Show officer list with details (name, badge, department)
- Support both initial assignment and reassignment
- Auto-create notifications for citizens

**Files to Check**:
- ✅ Component exists: [assign-officer-dialog.tsx](apps/web/components/reports/assign-officer-dialog.tsx)
- ✅ Already used in report detail page!
- Just needs testing with analyst account

### 2. 🔴 **CRITICAL: AI Analysis Module** (0% Complete)
**Impact**: VERY HIGH - Core differentiator for platform
**Status**: Routes exist in navigation but **ALL PAGES ARE 404**

**Missing Pages**:
- `/dashboard/analysis` - AI analysis dashboard **404**
- `/dashboard/analysis/new` - Create new analysis job **404**
- `/dashboard/analysis/history` - Analysis history **404**
- `/dashboard/analysis/xai` - Explainable AI panel **404**

**Missing API Routes**:
- `POST /api/analysis` - Create analysis job
- `GET /api/analysis` - List analysis jobs
- `GET /api/analysis/[id]` - Get analysis details
- `PATCH /api/analysis/[id]` - Update analysis status

**Database**: ✅ AnalysisJob model exists and ready

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Start with simple AI analysis dashboard
2. Create analysis job creation form
3. Integrate with AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or mock for now)
4. Display analysis results
5. Add history tracking

### 3. 🔴 **CRITICAL: Analytics Dashboard** (0% Complete)
**Impact**: HIGH - Business intelligence missing
**Status**: Route `/dashboard/analytics` exists but **PAGE IS 404**

**Need to Build**:
- Analytics dashboard with charts
- Trend analysis (reports over time)
- Geographic heat maps
- Performance metrics
- Data export (PDF, Excel)
- Custom report builder

**Recommended Libraries**:
- Recharts or Chart.js for charts
- React-PDF for PDF export
- XLSX for Excel export

### 4. 🟡 **Important: Case Builder Interface**
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Can create cases but no linking UI
**Status**: API works, but UI is basic

**Need to Build**:
- Case builder page with report selection
- Drag-and-drop or checkbox interface to link reports
- Visual relationship mapping
- Bulk operations (link multiple reports)

---

## 🔴 Critical Issues to Address

### Security & Permissions
1. ✅ Officer assignment permissions - **FIXED**
2. ⚠️ Rate limiting on API endpoints - **MISSING**
3. ⚠️ CSRF protection - **MISSING**
4. ⚠️ Input sanitization - **PARTIAL**

### Performance
1. ⚠️ No pagination on some list pages - **NEEDS FIX**
2. ⚠️ No image optimization (not using next/image) - **NEEDS FIX**
3. ⚠️ No caching strategy - **NEEDS FIX**
4. ⚠️ Map loads all markers at once (slow with 1000+ reports) - **NEEDS FIX**
