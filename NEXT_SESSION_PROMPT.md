# Next Session Prompt - PLAZA Toolkit Development

## Context
You are continuing development on the PLAZA Environmental Incident Investigation Platform. This is a Turborepo monorepo using Next.js 15, Prisma, and shadcn/ui components.

## What Has Been Completed

### âœ… Citizen Role (85% Complete)
- Dashboard with stats cards and recent reports
- "My Reports" page showing citizen's submitted reports
- Submit new report functionality with photo uploads
- Role-based navigation (simplified for citizens)
- Notification system for:
  - Report submission confirmation
  - Status changes (UNDER_REVIEW, IN_PROGRESS, RESOLVED, DISMISSED)
  - Officer assignment notifications
- Status timeline visualization on report detail page
- Restricted permissions (cannot assign officers, update status/priority)
- Smart back/cancel navigation based on role
- Report detail page with citizen-specific actions (Download PDF only)

### âœ… Analyst Role (Core Features Complete)
- Fixed notification navigation 404 error
- Implemented officer assignment UI:
  - AssignOfficerDialog component with dropdown selection
  - Shows officer details (name, badge, department)
  - Supports both initial assignment and reassignment
  - Auto-creates notifications for citizens when officer assigned
  - Success/error toasts with proper feedback
- Updated middleware to allow proper route access

### Files to Create

```
apps/web/app/dashboard/reports/assigned/page.tsx
apps/web/components/reports/update-status-dialog.tsx
apps/web/components/reports/notes-section.tsx
apps/web/components/reports/evidence-gallery.tsx
apps/web/components/cases/create-case-dialog.tsx
apps/web/app/api/reports/[id]/notes/route.ts
OFFICER_TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

### Files to Modify

```
apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx (add renderOfficerDashboard)
apps/web/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx (add officer actions)
apps/web/app/api/reports/[id]/route.ts (enhance status updates)
apps/web/app/api/evidence/route.ts (enhance evidence linking)
apps/web/app/api/cases/route.ts (already exists, needs completion)
apps/web/components/layout/side-nav.tsx (add officer nav items)
PLAZA_USER_ROLES_AND_WORKFLOWS.md (update officer status)
```

## Key Technical Considerations

### Authentication & Permissions
- Officers can only update status on reports assigned to them
- Officers can view all reports but only take action on assigned ones
- Analysts can assign/reassign reports to different officers
- Citizens should receive notifications for all status changes

### Database Relations
- Report â†’ Officer (assigneeId)
- Report â†’ Many Photos
- Report â†’ Many Evidence
- Report â†’ Many Notes (internal, not visible to citizens)
- Report â†’ Many Cases (via ReportCase junction)
- Case â†’ Many Reports
- Case â†’ Prosecutor (assignedToId)

### Notifications to Trigger
- When officer updates status â†’ notify citizen
- When officer adds evidence â†’ notify citizen (optional)
- When officer creates case â†’ notify prosecutor
- When officer adds note â†’ do NOT notify citizen (internal only)

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Server runs on: http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is busy)

# Database operations
pnpm db:push      # Push schema changes
pnpm db:generate  # Generate Prisma client
pnpm db:seed      # Seed test data
```

## Test Accounts

```
Citizen: john.doe@email.com / Password123!
Officer: mike.officer@email.com / Password123!
Analyst: sarah.analyst@email.com / Password123!
Prosecutor: david.prosecutor@email.com / Password123!
Admin: admin@plaza.gov / admin123!
```

## Success Criteria

## Notes

- The codebase uses **sonner** for toasts, not shadcn/ui toast
- All components use **client components** ("use client") when interactive
- Follow existing patterns in `apps/web/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx`
- Use `useAuthStore` from `@/lib/stores/auth.store` for current user
- API routes use `verifyAuth()` from `@/lib/auth-utils`
- Database operations use APIs from `@workspace/lib/db-api`
