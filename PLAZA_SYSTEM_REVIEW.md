## 18. Conclusion

The PLAZA Toolkit has a **solid foundation** but requires **significant work on AI/Analytics features** before launch. The core report, case, and evidence management features are well-implemented, and the user management system is production-ready.

**Critical Gap**: The AI Analysis module (Phase 6-7) is completely missing, which is a core differentiator for the platform and essential for the Analyst role. This should be the **top priority** before proceeding to other features.

**Recommendation**: Focus development efforts on:
1. AI Analysis Module (Phase 6-7) - 2 weeks
2. Analytics Dashboard (Phase 12) - 1 week
3. Citizen Portal (Phase 13) - 2 weeks
4. Settings & Help pages - 3 days
5. Security hardening - 1 week

**Estimated Time to MVP**: 6-8 weeks with focused development
