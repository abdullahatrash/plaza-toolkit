- Implemented proper loading skeletons
- Optimized auth checks to not fetch unnecessary data

### Developer Experience:
- Clear separation of concerns (layouts vs pages)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper TypeScript types throughout
- API routes follow RESTful patterns

## üéØ Next Session Plan

### Option 1: Complete Phase 5 (Map Features)
- Add heat map visualization using leaflet.heat (packages installed ‚úÖ)
- Implement drawing tools with leaflet-draw (packages installed ‚úÖ)
- Add cluster click handlers to show reports in area
- Create saved map views functionality

### Option 2: Start Phase 8 (Case Management)
- Create cases list page (`/dashboard/cases`)
- Build case detail with linked reports
- Implement case status workflow
- Add team assignment features

### Option 3: Start Phase 9 (Evidence Management)
- Create evidence list page
- Build evidence upload UI
- Implement chain of custody tracking
- Link evidence to reports and cases

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Continue with Phase 5** - Map features are half done, finish them first
2. **Then Phase 8** - Case management builds on reports
3. **Then Phase 9** - Evidence ties into both reports and cases
4. **Save AI for last** - Core CRUD features are more important

## üêõ Known Issues (Minor)

None! All critical bugs fixed ‚úÖ

## üìö Documentation Updates

- Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with Phase 4 completion status
- Added new features to phase checklist
- Marked phases 1-4 as 100% complete
- Reorganized remaining phases with AI deferred
