#### Features Implemented (11 major components)

**A. Officer Dashboard Enhancements**

**E. Notes API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/reports/[id]/notes` - Fetch notes with role-based filtering
- `POST /api/reports/[id]/notes` - Create investigation notes
- Only assigned officers, analysts, and admins can add notes
- Citizens see only public notes (isInternal: false)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Database Schema Understanding
- Note model uses `isInternal` boolean field, not enum
- ActivityType enum has `CREATE`, not `CASE_CREATED`
- Status transitions need validation at UI level
- Prisma relations for notes need proper includes

### Next.js Best Practices
- Use dynamic imports for client components
- Validate on both client and server
- Use proper TypeScript types
- Handle loading and error states

### Permission System
- Check permissions at multiple levels (UI, API, database)
- Validate role-based access in middleware
- Show appropriate UI based on user role
- Disable actions for unauthorized users
